# portfolio

I am frequently asked for a portfolio. With more than 45 years at the keyboard, putting one together is no small feat! Not to mention how NDAs complicate things.

But, finally, I have started one, going all the way back to the 1980s.

Many of these projects are screenshots, or replicas from memory, but hopefully even those will give you an idea of my journey through software engineering.
