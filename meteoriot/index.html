				Although my day job is business applications, I've always maintained that games and simulations push the language and hardware to their limits.  While this game did not push the Atari 800XL to its limits, it was a significant step in that direction for me as a developer, as well as a grounding in applied gravity, inertia and momentum.

				After each successful landing there would be more rocks, and more rugged terrain. After about level 20 or so, the game became impossible to play, although in my defence it was fun and challenging up until that point.
