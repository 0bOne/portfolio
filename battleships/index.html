				This game was inspired by the traditional paper-and-pencil grid-based game.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original code is long lost, so I have re-created it here in HTML5.  Unfortunately, I got a little carried away.  The original could, not of course, be played by two players across the internet -- there <i>was</i> no internet (at least not available to the public at large).  In my original game each player had to step away from the computer when it was not their turn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feel free to play this game, but remain within shouting distance of your opponent.  This is because of two significant shortcomings (sorry, ran out of time!): (1) there is no notification of when a ship is completely sunk and (2) There is no notification of a winner.
