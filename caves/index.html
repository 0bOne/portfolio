				In the early days, there were few, if any, graphical games.  Adventure games, such as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure' target='_blank'>Colossal Cave<a> were more common.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to see if I could do something like that as my first ever programming project.  Of course, I didn't have a mainframe available to store all that text and data. So I used a pseudo random number generator to come up with a maze and treasures. These could be generated from minimal data during game initialization, yet have sufficient variety to simulate a large, pre-defined game environment. 
				There is very little command processing: you can't look, or drop, or use anything. Nor is there any endpoint. But, hey, it was my first project.
			</p>
			<p>It was fun to write, and (by the standards of the day) fun to play for, oh, at least 5 minutes.</p>
			<p>I have re-created it here in JavaScript using JQuery and a game Object -- so the code looks nothing like the original (and I doubt the gameplay is close either, after 31 years). Nevertheless, if you are really nostalgic for text-based adventure games, or have been in cryogenic suspension for the last 3 decades you can play it.  I have set it up to use the query parameter ?maze as the seed, so you can play multiple games. And, yes, I have taken a few shortcuts in the re-creation.</p>
			
			<p>
				As many JavaScript developers will realize, there is no native capability to create pseduo-random numbers.  Hence I have borrowed David Bau's excellent script, which can be found here: <a href='http://davidbau.com/encode/seedrandom.js'>http://davidbau.com/encode/seedrandom.js</a>
