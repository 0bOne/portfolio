				Top marks for this project, although it was by far the easiest of the three.  All I had to do was examine a few forms and receipts  from my parents' public house and build a database around them.  I suspect the evaluators did not dig into the code too far or my monopoly game would have come out first. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to being the easiest of the my three graduation projects, it was also the least fun to write: no room for creativity: just replicate a paper-based business workflow in code.  On the other hand, no public house "landlord" (as they are referred to) would have, in those days, replaced a perfectly good cash register and account books with a several-thousand dollar 380Z, so this was strictly an exercise in what was possible, rather than what was practical.
			</p>
			<p>The original program and data have long since been lost. Even if they hadn't, I would have no 380Z on which to run it. Here, I've simulated several screens with a DOS batch file.  Memory is a funny, thing, so I don't guarantee it matches the original, but at least it gives an idea</p>
