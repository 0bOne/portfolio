				As an armchair physicist and full-on computer programmer it was natural (for me at least) to combine the two.  This particular project was for fun, and it followed my learning of two important astronomy concepts: Newton's universal law of gravitation (the force of gravity is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them) and the knowledge that a comet's tail always points away from the sun.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Up until then I thought that a comet, as the Bayeux tapestry depicts, had a tail that streams out behind it like a contrail.  In fact it's more like a steam ship, where the smoke from the smokestack follows the wind.  A comet's tail always follows the solar wind, which means it points away from the Sun, regardless of the comet's direction of travel.
			</p>
			<p>				
				The original required careful attention to performance. For example, I had to carefully erase only the comet and its tail - as a full screen redraw was far too slow. In this version I just wipe the canvas and start over!
			</p>
			<p>
				I have re-created it here in JavaScript using JQuery and an HTML5 canvas -- so as usual the code looks nothing like the original. I also recall a few more settings on the original, but can't remember exactly what they were. Nevertheless, this will give you an idea.
