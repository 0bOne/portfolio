				My only "grade B" project! I was informed ahead of time that the games usually received lower grades compared to applications, but I have never believed that bureaucracy should stand in the way of an interesting project.
			</p>
			<p>
				Games have, for a long time, pushed the limits of computing more than business applications: whether ui, memory, rules, storage, or bandwidth, this is axiomatic, so my purpose here was to push as many of those limits as my somewhat narrow experience allowed.  The 380Z had only the most rudimentary graphics capability, and really required machine code programming to use it well. While I knew may way around the Z80A processor, the project specification was a BASIC program. Hence, my "text based adventure" approach to the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				My purpose here was to be able to handle a large amount of data in a relatively small amount of RAM: 16k for the program, data and graphics.  Not a lot for a monopoly game which has 40 spaces, chance cards, community chest cards, and a large number of rules and messages.  It took several attempts to get this to fit into available RAM!
			</p>
			<p>Of course, by today's standards, techniques and technologies, it is simplistic. Nevertheless, it was one of my first ever projects, and was a lot of fun to create</p>
			<p>The original program and data have long since been lost. Even if they hadn't, I would have no 380Z on which to run it and no time to re-create the whole thing. Here, I've simulated several screens with a DOS batch file.  Memory is a funny thing, so I don't guarantee it matches the original, but at least it gives an idea</p>
