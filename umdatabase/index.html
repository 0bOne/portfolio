				Although I say so myself, somewhat ahead of its time (see <a href='http://www.ustudy.in/node/4091' target='new'>this article</a>, although not entirely relational by today's popular understanding of the term.

				It is widely believed that the term <i>relational</i> database refers to the relationships between tables (entity relationships). Technically speaking, however, it refers to the fact that each datum in a <i>row</i> within the table are related: a concept known as a <i>record</i>.  My database design program had tables, and therefore records, but it had no concept of entity relationships. It did support multiple tables within a single database. Ted Codd's pioneering relational work was more than a decade into its evolution, but his concepts were not widely understood.

			<p>My original program has long since been lost. Even it they hadn't I would have no 380Z on which to run it. Here I've approximated a few screens using a DOS batch file.  Memory is a funny, thing, so I don't guarantee it matches the original, but at least it gives an idea</p>
