				In my quest to conquer the world of the 3d, inspired by Bell and Braben's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_%28video_game%29'>Elite&tm;</a> I created several 3d "worlds", including this maze.  To rudimentary to be called games, they focused on 3d Rendering. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd recently created a wireframe "mountain" scape similar to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_%281980_video_game%29'><i>Battlezone&tm;</i></a> and observed that it didn't take a lot of detail to bring smoothness of scrolling to a halt.
				
				I wanted to push the limits, so I created this 3d "maze" -- the maze was auto-generated and there were no enemies.
				
				Bit-blitting and tweening were terminology that I wouldn't hear until decades later. Nevertheless, this simulation used machine code to "blit" wall shapes from offscreen RAM onscreen to create the effect of smooth movement between fixed nodes in the maze.
			</p>
			<p>
				To give you an idea of what this was like I have included an image of the Sinclair ZX81's <i>Monster Maze</i> almost certainly a subconscious inspiration.  My graphics and animation were considerably smoother, but then again I had better hardware by a generation.  Monster Maze was limited to special characters that extended the ASCII set, whereas I had access to pixels and more than twice the display resolution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually I hope to find the time to re-create this in HTML5 where it will almost certainly run smoothly without resorting to anything like machine language -- and probably 0.1% of the code size!
